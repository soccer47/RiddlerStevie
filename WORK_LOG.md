| Aug 22 | time in class-4:00pm |                                                                                                                    I figured out how how to decode 1-3, and have written the code to decode 1 |
| Aug 22 |     4:00-4:30pm      |                                                                                    I coded the deciphering code for messages 2 and 3, and am currently trying to figure out how to decipher 4 |
| Aug 22 |     4:30-5:00pm      |                                                                                                I coded problem number 4, however I'm not sure if the tester algorithm is functioning properly |
| Aug 22 |  7-8pm, 9:15-9:30pm  |                                                 I recoded the functions 1-3 so that they functioned correctly, as I mistakelnly thought that they worked before. (forgot to update log sorry) |
| Aug 23 |       8-8:30am       |                       I've done everything for messages 1-3, but still don't know how to decipher 4. I think it has something to do with UTF-8 or unicode, and I think the truck is the space |
| Aug 23 |     5:20-5:56pm      | I figured out how to decipher message 4 (Unicode value of characters - 10,000 + 81, with 81 being equal to ascii val of lowercase 'a' - 19, which is unicode val of the truck/space - 10,000) |
| Aug    |        5:58pm        |                                                                                                                                                                                      finished |
